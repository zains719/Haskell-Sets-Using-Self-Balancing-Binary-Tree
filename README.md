# Haskell-Sets-Using-Self-Balancing-Binary-Tree

{-
  Your task is to design a datatype that represents the mathematical concept of
  a (finite) set of elements (of the same type). We have provided you with an
  interface (do not change this!) but you will need to design the datatype and
  also support the required functions over sets. Any functions you write should
  maintain the following invariant: no duplication of set elements.
  There are lots of different ways to implement a set. The easiest is to use a
  list. Alternatively, one could use an algebraic data type, wrap a binary
  search tree, or even use a self-balancing binary search tree. Extra marks will
  be awarded for efficient implementations (a self-balancing tree will be more
  efficient than a linked list for example).
  You are **NOT** allowed to import anything from the standard library or other
  libraries.
